# Climbing-simulation-of-a-quadrupedal-robot
Dynamic simulation of a quadrupedal robot climbing steep wall with several anchors. The control strategy is a novel algorithm based on Potential Energy Landscape Theory developed in Terradynamics at JHU.

The simulation is to figure out whether our proposed control strategy based on potential energy landscape modelling can be successful in the stable landing task on given anchors.

The example of simulation result in one frame is showed as follows:
